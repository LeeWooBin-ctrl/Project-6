    presents the performance of three vision transformer models—ViT, BEiT, and Swin—evaluated using a subset of the test dataset. Although the Swin model demonstrated high accuracy during training, it showed poor and unstable performance on the test set. The BEiT model achieved higher test accuracy than the ViT model; however, the ViT model exhibited more consistent improvement in accuracy as the number of epochs increased and showed better performance during training. Based on this trend, we hypothesized that the ViT model would achieve further improvement when trained on the full dataset. Therefore, we selected the ViT model for our final experiments.
